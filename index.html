		<h3>
		 Topics of interest for this combined workshop include (but are not limited to):
		</h3>

		<ul>
		 <li>
		  expressiveness and rigorous comparisons between models of computation
		  (process algebras, event structures, Petri nets, rewrite systems)

				I will introduce timed actors for modeling distributed systems and will explain our theories, techniques and tools for model checking and performance evaluation of such models. Timed Rebeca can be used to model asynchronous and event-based components in systems. Real-time features, like computation delay, network delay and periodic behavior, can be modeled in the language. I will explain how floating-time transition system can be used for model checking of such models when we are interested in event-based properties, and how it helps in state space reduction. I will show different applications of our approach including analyzing a wireless sensor network application, mobile ad-hoc network protocols, network-on-chip designs, and interoperable medical devices.

				<br><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:normal">Abstract:</span><br>
				Hyperproperties are properties of sets of traces. Compared to simple trace properties, their satisfaction can depend on the traces in a set interacting with each other or, for example, the average of some quantity along individual traces. Temporal hyperlogics emerged to capture such properties by allowing the use of quantifiers. These logics allowed for viewing the verified set of traces independently of what system might be producing it, and this unlocked the possibility of using hyperlogics for expressing, for example, consensus-type properties. The verification for these two approaches, one where it is the set of traces produced by a single system and one where it is not, are also orthogonal. In this talk, we will set the foundations of this topic, understand the key attributes that make hyperlogics so fascinating, and look into some current trends.

				<br><span style="font-weight:bold;font-style:normal">Abstract:</span><br>
				A typical computer user knows the difference between what can be undone on a computer, and what cannot. They may be familiar with the “undo” feature of text editors but understand the impossibility of recovering an unsaved document after an emergency shutdown. Creating programs guaranteeing that any action can be undone requires to design and implement reversible programming languages. While such languages come with interesting built-in security features (because any past action can be investigated), they also raise challenges when it comes to concurrency. Indeed, undoing an action that involved synchronization between multiple actors requires all actors to agree to undo said action.
Process algebras offer an interesting frame to study reversible computation, and reciprocally. Enriching process algebras such as CCS with memory, identifiers or keys, allowed to represent reversible computation, and in turn helped gained a finer understanding of causality, bisimulations, and other “true concurrency” notions. This talk offers to briefly motivates the interests of reversible computation, and to discuss the new lights it shed on process algebras.

The un/decidability of the problem depends on the specific asynchronous semantics considered as well as the topology (the communication flow) of the system.Synchronisability is known to be undecidable under the peer-to-peer semantics, while it is still an open problem for mailbox communication. The problem was shown to be decidable for ring topologies. In this paper, we show that when restricting to automata with accepting states, synchronisability is undecidable under the mailbox semantics, this result is obtained by resorting to the Post Correspondence problem. In an attempt to solve the general problem, we also show that synchronisability is decidable for tree topologies (where, as well as for rings, peer-to-peer coincides with mailbox semantics).</span><br><span style="font-weight:400;font-style:normal">We also discuss synchronisability for multitrees in the mailbox setting.</span></td>

The semantic descriptions of LTL3 in previous work are given only in terms of the relationship to conventional LTL. Our approach, by contrast, gives a full model-based inductive accounting of the semantics of LTL3, in terms of families of definitive prefix sets. We show that our definitive prefix sets are isomorphic to linear-time temporal properties (sets of infinite traces), and thereby show that our semantics of LTL3 directly correspond to the semantics of conventional LTL. In addition, we formalise the formula progression evaluation technique, popularly used in runtime verification and testing contexts, and show its soundness and completeness up to finite traces with respect to our semantics. All of our definitions and proofs are mechanised in Isabelle/HOL.</span></td>

Such systems can be compared via forward-reverse bisimilarity as well as its two components, i.e., forward bisimilarity and reverse bisimilarity. The properties of these equivalences have already been studied in the setting of sequential processes. In this paper we address concurrent processes and investigate compositionality and axiomatizations of forward bisimilarity, which is interleaving, and reverse and forward-reverse bisimilarities, which are truly concurrent. To uniformly derive expansion laws for the three equivalences, we develop encodings based on the proved trees approach. In the case of reverse and forward-reverse bisimilarities, we show that every action prefix in the expansion needs to be extended with the backward ready set of the state reached by the corresponding transition. Furthermore, we prove that forward-reverse bisimilarity augmented with a clause for backward ready multisets equality corresponds to hereditary history-preserving bisimilarity, thereby providing for the latter equivalence a new axiomatization as well as an operational characterization.</span></td>

Thereby, one multi-dimensional energy game can be used to characterize and decide a wide array of weak behavioral equivalences between stability-respecting branching bisimilarity and weak trace equivalence in one go. To establish correctness, we relate attacker-winning energy budgets and distinguishing sublanguages of Hennessy–Milner logic that we characterize by eight dimensions of formula expressiveness.</span></td>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
The EXPRESS workshops aim at bringing together researchers interested in the expressiveness of various formal systems and semantic notions, particularly in the field of concurrency.
Their focus has	traditionally been on the comparison between programming concepts (such as concurrent, functional, imperative, logic and object-oriented programming) and between mathematical models of computation (such as process algebras, Petri nets, event structures, modal logics, and rewrite systems) on the basis of their relative expressive power.
The EXPRESS workshop series has run successfully since 1994 and over the years this focus has become broadly construed.

The SOS workshops aim at being a forum for researchers, students and practitioners interested in new
developments, and directions for future investigation, in the field of structural operational semantics.
One of the specific goals of the SOS workshop series is to establish synergies between the concurrency and programming language communities working on the theory and practice of SOS. Reports on applications of SOS to other fields are also most welcome, including: modelling and analysis of biological systems, security of computer systems programming, modelling and analysis of embedded systems, specification of middle-ware and coordination languages, programming language semantics and implementation, static analysis software and hardware verification, semantics for domain-specific languages and model-based engineering.

Since 2012, the EXPRESS and SOS communities have joined forces and organised a combined EXPRESS/SOS workshop. The past combined workshops were a success, so this year there will again be a combined workshop on the semantics of systems and programming concepts, and on the expressiveness of mathematical models of computation.

This year marks the 30th edition of EXPRESS and the 20th edition of SOS.
